	<h1>3D Modeling Headphone</h1>
	<p>This is a masterpiece I did on my Mid Semester Assessment. The assessment topic is "Things that is Precious to you". I chose this Razer Chroma 7.1 Headphone as it was my first Razer Merchandise that I bought with my own part-time pay.</p>
	
	<p>While I was creating this heaphone, I break it to 4 parts.
	<ol>
		<li>The headband.</li>
		<li>The 2 speakers.</li>
		<li>The cable with addition Velcro.</li>
		<li>The USB.</li>
	</ol>
	</p>
	<p>
	This headphone has an additional of Retractable Microphones.

		<h1>Steps</h1>
		<p>
		To create this part of the headband, I took estimately 7 steps excluding texturing. </p>
		
		<ol>
		<li>Create Polygon Pipe.</li>
		<li>Cut the bottom half.</li>
		<li>Go to vertex mode.</li>
		<li>Adjust the size and flexibility.</li>
		<li>Extrude the sides of the pipes.</li>
		<li>Edge loop tool to create extra lines.</li>
		<li>Extrude to get the excess “connection”.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h1>Issue Faced</h1>
		<p>
		The difficulty I faced for this part of the headphone is the texturing. I could not find the razer logo together with the leather texture. </p>
		
		<h1>Solution</h1>
		<p> To fix that issue, I went to photoshop and combine a leather texture with the razer logo and save is at Jpeg as shown.</p>

		<p>
		The speaker part is mostly extrusion from a Cylinder. As you can see, there is a lot of bumps at the side of the speaker. If I recall correctly, I had 9 Sub divisions before extruding each layer to give this outcome.</p>
		
		<ol>
		<li>Create Polygon Cylinder.</li>
		<li>Extrude the top part to fit with the “connection”.</li>
		<li>Sub divisions are created to extrude to make the ear cuff cushions.</li>
		<li>Duplicate special and flip for the right speaker.</li>
			<p>Addition steps for the Right Speaker.</p>
			<li>From the duplicate special of left speaker, extrude the bottom part to connect to cable.</li>
			<li>Create extra lines on the side and extrude for the microphone.</li>
		</ol>

		<h1>Steps</h1>
		<p>
		Let's start with the cable first. The cable is extrude by the right speaker. To get this, I made use of a method I learned in one of the lesson where we extrude using any type of curves. For this one, I made use of the Bexier curve as I was much comfortable with handling it.
		</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>From the bottom part of right speaker, extrude different sizes of squares.</li>
			<li>Draw a Bezier curve, coil it up like so.</li>
			<li>Place the curve near the extruded square.</li>
			<li>Click the square face and curve, click extrude and set the sections higher. This is so that the coiling part is smoother.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h1>Issue Faced</h1>
		<p>
			I had to redo the cable several times due to the coiling overlap issue. As you can see the method I mentioned, I positioned the curve into coiling followed by the extrusion. Sometimes, when you extrude, it wll overlap the others and not look natural. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Another issue I faced is the connecting the cable to both headset and the USB. I came up with the Error: “polyBridgeEdge requires equal number of border edges”.
		</p>
		
		<h1>Solution</h1>
		<p> I had to go vertex mode, adjust the height of each curve. This will seperate the curves from overlapping each other.</p>
		
		<p>As for the connection, I had to delete some of the extra vertex/edges.</p>
		
		<h1>Steps</h1>
		<p>
		The velcro is an add on to organize the cable. It also makes the cable look more realistic as typically, we see organized cable is usually tied up with velcro or rubber bands.
		</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Create an extra Bezier curve and coil around the coiled cable</li>
			<li>Create a Polygon Cube and extrude with the curve (similar to cable)</li>
			<li>Go to vertex mode and play around with the vertices to tighten the Velcro.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h1>Issue Faced</h1>
		<p>
			 Texturing of the Velcro. Using the same method as the cable, after the extrusion of polygon, I had a hard time to click on the faces.
		</p>
		
		<h1>Solution</h1>
		<p> I had to go to vertex mode and unwrap the velcro first before applying the texture.</p>

		<h1>Steps</h1>
		<p>
		For the USB, I took a texture online. The logo of a typical USB and the Razer logo that is written on the USB. 
		</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Create a Polygon Cube.</li>
			<li>Extrude the sides and back to make it extrude inwards giving the shape.</li>
			<li>For the metallic part, extrude inwards for both square hole and the insertion to USB port.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h1>Issue Faced</h1>
		<p>
		The metallic part of USB where I have to extrude inwards was a little tough as I couldn't see much of the interior as the hole is small.
		</p>
		
		<h1>Solution</h1>
		<p> I had zoom in slowly in order to change some of the shapes inside. Even if I use cntrl + F, it was not able to frame the section I want therefore this is the only solution.</p>
